          <p className="text-gray-700">
            The ECO 4 (Energy Company Obligation) scheme is a government initiative aimed at improving
            energy efficiency in UK homes, particularly for low-income households. It offers funding
            for energy-saving improvements like insulation, heating upgrades, and solar installations.

            You may be eligible if you receive certain government benefits or if your household income

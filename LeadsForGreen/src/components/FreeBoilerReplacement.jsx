      If you’re a homeowner in the UK, you may be eligible for a free or heavily subsidised boiler replacement under the ECO 4 scheme. The scheme is designed to help lower-income households or those in fuel poverty make their homes more energy-efficient by providing funding for energy-saving measures, including boiler replacement.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
      At Simplex ECO, we specialize in providing ECO 4 funding to help eligible homeowners access the funding they need to replace their old and inefficient boilers. By upgrading to a new and more energy-efficient boiler, you can reduce your energy bills and save money in the long term.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
      Under the ECO 4 scheme, boiler replacement funding is available to homeowners who meet the ECO criteria as set by Ofgem, and whose existing boiler is either non-condensing or has an efficiency rating of less than 86%. The scheme provides funding to cover the cost of installation, as well as any necessary repairs or upgrades to your heating system.

      <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
      At Simplex ECO, we work with fully qualified and certified installers who will be PAS2030 and Trustmark certified. This means that you can be confident that the installation will be of high quality and carried out to the highest standards.
